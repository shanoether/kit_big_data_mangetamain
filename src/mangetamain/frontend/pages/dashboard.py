Welcome to Mangetamain v1.0, your interactive platform for exploring recipes and user interactions. This main page serves as the starting point of the app, providing guidance on navigation and an overview of the project.\
Use the sidebar to move between different sections and explore analyses. Once the data is loaded, you'll see a confirmation of the number of interactions available, giving you a quick sense of the dataset's size. This page sets the stage for deeper insights into user reviews, recipe characteristics, and contributor activity throughout the app.",
